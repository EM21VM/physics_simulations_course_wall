## Intro
### Intro: LAs take vectors and return vectors. Using pictures as representing all vectors in a region.
### Examples of LAs in 2D: scaling, rotation, shear, mirror, project.

## More math
### More rigorous definition: addition + scaling.
### Properties of LAs: perserve zero + parallel lines, scale areas uniformly.

## Vectors and basis sets
### Reminder: vectors as linear combinations of basis vectors.

## From LAs to Matrices
### The most general form of LAs. Example in $\mathbb{R}^{2}:\ \left(x,y\right) \to \left(ax+by, cx+dy\right)$.
### From LAs to matrices using the basis vectors.
### Write examples from beginning as 2x2 matrices.
### Generalize concepts to $\mathbb{R}^{3},\ \mathbb{R}^{n}$.

## The deteminant
### The determinant + how to calculate it for the 2x2 case.
### Rank + Null space of a matrix.

## Matrix-matrix product
### Matrix product as LA composition.

## Eigenvalues and eigenvectors
### Eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
