## Intro
### Intro: LTs take vectors and return vectors. Using pictures as representing all vectors in a region.
### Examples of LTs in 2D: scaling, rotation, shear, mirror, project.

## More math
### More rigorous definition: addition + scaling.
### Properties of LTs: perserve zero + parallel lines, scale areas uniformly.

## Vectors and basis sets
### Reminder: vectors as linear combinations of basis vectors.

## From LTs to Matrices
### The most general form of LTs. Example in $\mathbb{R}^{2}:\ \left(x,y\right) \to \left(ax+by, cx+dy\right)$.
### From LTs to matrices using the basis vectors.
### Write examples from beginning as 2x2 matrices.
### Generalize concepts to $\mathbb{R}^{3},\ \mathbb{R}^{n}$.

## The deteminant
### Definition and properties
### How to calculate the determinant for the 2x2 case.
### Rank + Null space of a matrix.

## Matrix-matrix product
### Matrix product as LT composition.

## Eigenvalues and eigenvectors
### Eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
