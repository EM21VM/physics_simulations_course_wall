# Physics Simulation with Python
## 23IT1, Winter Semester 2024

### About
This repository has all the relevant resources for the Physics Simulations with Python course.

Unsurprisingly, the python code can be found under [code](https://github.com/pelegs/physics_simulations_course/tree/main/code), and the lecture notes under [notes](https://github.com/pelegs/physics_simulations_course/tree/main/notes).

### Assignment ideas
For the final assignments of the course, I collected some ideas in [this google docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Wq9SW6MhJ1XLFPA3RocyrbcJpeqHmc-5YARsDZU-kGY/edit?usp=sharing).
If you want to add ideas simply comment with the topic and general idea (one line please), and I will insert it into the doc.
